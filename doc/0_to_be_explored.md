# Packages/data sources to be explored and ideas of plotting projects

### Ideas

- **La Espa√±a vaciada**:
  - Make a map of Spain with the travel distance to a hospital facility (possible packages to use: [opentripplanner](https://docs.ropensci.org/opentripplanner/) to compute the distance and [osmdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/osmdata/) to locate hospitals).
  - Think how to infer the cell phone or internet coverage from public data to make a map (i.e. from geolocated tweets).
      - Data on internet conexion from Speedtest [here](https://www.speedtest.net/insights/blog/announcing-ookla-open-datasets/)

### R packages (ROpenSci)

- [rWBclimate](https://docs.ropensci.org/rWBclimate/): An R interface for the World Bank climate data used in the World Bank climate knowledge portal.
- [isdparser](https://docs.ropensci.org/isdparser/): Parse NOAA Integrated Surface Data Files
- [ots](https://docs.ropensci.org/ots/): an R client to retrieve data from various ocean time series datasets, including BATS, HOT, CALCOFI, LTER Kelp and UOPG.
- [rrricanesdata](https://docs.ropensci.org/rrricanesdata/): All product datasets for every cyclone that has developed in the north Atlantic and northeast Pacific basins since 1998.
- [rnaturalearth](https://docs.ropensci.org/rnaturalearth/): An R package to hold and facilitate interaction with Natural Earth map data.
- [rWind](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rWind/index.html): Tools for download and manage surface wind and sea currents data from the Global Forecasting System.
