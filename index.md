# *R miscellanea:* Exploratory plotting exercises with R

This is intended to be a repository of code of my personal exploratory plotting exercises with new R packages/datasets, mostly shared through my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GuillemSalazar):



- [Contributions to the challange *#30díasdegráficos*](https://github.com/GuillemSalazar/desafio_30_dias_de_graficos) (one plot per day during 30 days, in Spanish)
- [Rail transport network of the three largest cities in Spain](./doc/1_osm.md) (exploration of the **osmdata** package)
