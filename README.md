# *R miscellanea:* Exploratory plotting exercises with R

This is intended to be a repository of code of my personal exploratory plotting exercises with new R packages/datasets, mostly shared through my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/GuillemSalazar):



- [Contributions to the challange *#30díasdegráficos*](#contributions_to_the_challange_30díasdegráficos) (one plot per day during 30 days)
- [Rail transport network of the three biggest cities in Spain](#rail-transport-network-of-the-three-biggest-cities-in-Spain) (exploration of the **osmdata** package)

### Contributions to the challange 30díasdegráficos

My contributions to the challange **#30díasdegráficos** consisting on releasing in Twitter one plot per day during 30 days. The whole collection of plots may be found in [here](https://github.com/cienciadedatos/datos-de-miercoles/blob/master/30-dias-de-graficos-2020.md)

### Rail transport network of the three biggest cities in Spain
